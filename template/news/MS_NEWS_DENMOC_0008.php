                            <p>Most nationalities are required to obtain tourist visa in advance to travel to Vietnam.
                                When obtaining your visa you should allow 3 weeks for processing with your nearest
                                embassy or consulate, the cost is approximately US$60 to US$100. Please check with your
                                embassy or consulate for further requirements.</p>
                            <p>Some nationalities are exempt from visas for a stay of a maximum of 15 days, including
                                British, German, French, Spanish and Italian citizens travelling to Vietnam (for all
                                purposes). This exemption period is currently effective until 30 June 2021, and is based
                                upon meeting all conditions prescribed by Vietnamese laws. If you are planning on
                                staying in Vietnam for longer than 15 days you will need to obtain a visa extension in
                                advance (please contact your relevant Consulate or Embassy). Please also check
                                requirements if you plan to re-enter Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>An eVisa is available for some nationalities including passport holders from Australia
                                (from 2018), France, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada and the
                                United States of America, valid for a single entry of a maximum of 30 days stay in
                                Vietnam. For information on obtaining an eVisa visit the immigration website:
                                https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/</p>
                            <p>Evisas take up to 3 days to be processed. You will need a clear electronic copy of your
                                passport data page and passport photo, and to make a non-refundable payment as outlined
                                on the immigration website.<br>
                                Keep the customs and immigration form you receive on arrival, as you need it to complete
                                exit formalities on departure.</p>
                            <p>If your visa application asks for a point of contact, please write: Intrepid Vietnam 5th

                            <p>Most nationalities do not require a letter of invitation for Vietnam but if you do need

                            <p>The LGBQTI community is gradually gaining recognition in Vietnam, with gay pride parades
                                becoming a regular occurrence and a lift on same-sex marriage bans in 2015. With that
                                said, Vietnam is stil a conservative culture and many still hide their sexuality from
                                their families. Ho CHi Minh City and Hanoi have some gay-friendly bars and
                                events.&nbsp;It is generally recommended that both gay and straight couples resist

                                    target="_blank">accessible</a>, regardless of ability or disability. Thatâ€™s why we
                                do our best to help as many people see the world as possible, regardless of any physical
                                or mental limitations they might have. Weâ€™re always happy to talk to travellers with
                                disabilities and see if we can help guide them towards the most suitable itinerary for
                                their needs and where possible, make reasonable adjustments to our itineraries.</p>
                            <p>Despite having a high population of people with disabilities, accessible infrastructure
                                and facilities are still limited in Vietnam. Chaotic traffic and pavements blocked by
                                parked motorbikes and street stalls, uneven footpaths and high curbs add to the
                                challenges of getting around for travellers with mobility or vision disabilities. Most
                                entrances to hotels, shops, restaurants and tourist sites will have steps and many
                                doorways will not be able to accommodate wheelchairs wider than 60cm. Some sights and
                                destinations will not be fully accessible (ie. Ha Long Bay boats, Cu Chi Tunnels) but
                                other places such as Hoi An are flat and much more wheelchair-friendly. There are likely
                                to be situations where travellers with disabilities may need to rely on local people to
                                help. Taxis are readily available and an affordable way to get around for travellers who
                                are not confident in exploring independently on foot.</p>
